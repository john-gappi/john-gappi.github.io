         <h3>A taste of my work.</h3>
         <p><span class="bold">Feed Your Curiosity</span> is a trifold flyer design for the New York Public Library. I wanted to use bold colours accompanied by strong typography and visual elements to create movement and activate the words within the title.</p>

         <p>The Brewtal Truth is a beer brand for politicans. Inspired by the 2016 US elections, I wanted to create a logo with strong symbolism, combining contemporary and traditional design.</p>
